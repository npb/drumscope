* Make ClickTrack an GObject with reference counting
    * DrumscopeActor should hold a weak reference

* Add full screen mode

* Paint weaker line for BAR_SUB (dotted?)

* Handle re-config while running

* Unify ClickTrack and DrumTrack?

* Create preferences dialog for MIDI mapping etc

* DrumscopeActor: Cursor handling should not be in the paint method.
